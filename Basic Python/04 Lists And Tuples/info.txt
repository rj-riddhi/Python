Python collections (Arrays)

In python we have 4 collection data types (List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary )
- List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members. 

- Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members. 

- Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members. 

- Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
