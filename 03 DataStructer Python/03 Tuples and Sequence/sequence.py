# Sequences are a general category in Python that includes:
# Lists ([1, 2, 3])
# Tuples ((1, 2, 3))
# Strings ("hello")
# Ranges (range(5))
# etc.

# Basically, anything where you can access elements by an index and order matters.

# Common Sequence Operations
# All sequences (list, tuple, string...) support these:

# 1) Indexing: s[0] returns first element
# 2) Slicing:	s[1:4] returns	slice of sequence
# 3) Length: len(s) returns number of items
# 4) Membership test:	'a' in s returns True/False
# 5) Iteration: for item in s:	Looping
# 6) Concatenation: s1 + s2 returns Combine sequences
# 7) Repetition: s * 3	Repeat sequence
# 8) Min/Max (for numbers): min(s), max(s) returns	Smallest, largest
